# "Ed, Edd, n Eddy" API - backend

### About

One of the TV shows of my childhood was Cartoon Network's "Ed, Edd, n Eddy".

Beginning my foray into choosing and building coding projects of my own after graduating from Code Fellows, I wanted to create an API.

During my time in class, we often used lightweight APIs such as the Pokemon API or the Star Wars API in order to get proof of life on projects.

Creating this API accomplishes a few things for me:

- I get to do what developers do: develop
- I get to provide a resource for anybody needing to bring in API information in a project for proof of life or any other purpose it may serve
- I get to add a new flavor of API to the internet (at least I think, I Googled for an Ed, Edd, Eddy API and couldn't find anything)
